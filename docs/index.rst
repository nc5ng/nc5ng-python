nc5ng-python documentation pages
================================

``nc5ng-python`` is a project providing python libraries for import, analysis, generation, plotting, export, filitering, and manipulation of  geodetic datum transformation data.

The source data for transformations come from the United States National Geodetic Survey `NADCON5` data and ``Fortran`` processing programs  linked into python in the nc5ng.org project  ``nadcon5-ng`` (`Home Page <https://www.nc5ng.org/projects/nadcon5-ng>`_) . Transformation grids can be provided from either source or built yourself (See: :ref:`s-install-conversion`)
